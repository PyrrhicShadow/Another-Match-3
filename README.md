    <summary><i>Click for secrets</i></summary>

<p>These are technically debugging tools but I left them in here as cheat-codes/easter eggs. Have fun!</p>

<ul>
    <li> "s" key to shuffle the board </li>
        <ul>
            <li> shuffle happens automatically at deadlock, but manual shuffle is helpful if looking for a specific configuration</li>
        </ul>
    <li> bomb commands (turns the piece the mouse is hovering over into said bomb)</li>
        <ul>
            <li> "c" key for color bomb</li>
            <li> "a" key for adjacent bomb</li>
            <li> right or left arrow key for row bomb</li>
            <li> up or down arrow key for col bomb </li>
            <li> right-mouse to unmake bomb </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<p>The features also include "replayability", which references how all the levels change after you've successfully summoned the daemon traped in the game. Don't worry, you'll know when you've successfully summoned the daemon.</p>
